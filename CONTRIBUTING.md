# Contributing to Node-wifi

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to node-wifi.

1. Fork `node-wifi` repository
2. Post an issue to propose your feature/improvement. It will be very useful to know if your idea has a chance to be accepted
3. Implement your feature
4. Test your feature
5. Squash your commits into one
6. Write your commit message following [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/)
7. Create pull request for dev branch

> :information_source: Version 3 will be released soon and will provide a (lot of changes)[https://github.com/friedrith/node-wifi/projects/1]. Don't worry, everything will be retrocompatible. But it is every important to create an issue before proposing a pull request to integrate the fix
> directly in the version 2 release.

And please try to consider your development for windows, linux and macOS platforms at the same time
because having a module compatible with all platforms is the main concern of `node-wifi`.

**May the force be with you !!**
